 👋 Hi, I’m @KewaunC
 👀 I’m interested in anime, video games, nature. I LOVE POKEMON, Destiny 2, DragonFable, discussing how to expose others into coding and get them into it!
 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Node, Mongodb and I just want to keep learning programming langauges.
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Pokemon ROM hack (need to get more exp first :P). I also just want to reach out to other Software Engineers doesnt matter how much or how little your expierience is I want to meet you and chat! 
 📫 How to reach me @KewaunCainDev or on Discord Kewaun#3771.
